* The original [Matlab bindings](https://github.com/daeyun/poisson-surface-reconstruction) were developed by [Daeyun Shin](https://github.com/daeyun).
* Adapted to Python by [Miguel Molero](https://github.com/mmolero/pypoisson) as a separate project [pypoisson](https://github.com/mmolero/pypoisson), which ultimately got outdated.
* Modernized to version 13.72 and contributed directly to the main repository by [Harsh Bhatia](https://github.com/bhatiaharsh) for improved versioning and management.
